# Cart_Abandonment
This is an classification model which predicts the customer will do cart abandonment or not.

## Installation
1. Python3.6
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. sklearn
8. scipy

## Motivation
This project is developed to predict if a customer will leave after adding products to cart or he will purchase that item. By knowing this, let's say if we can predict that a customer will do abandonment then we gave that customer some special discount so that he can able to do checkout.

## Files in the repository
1. data_cart_abandonment.csv : The dataset file.
2. cart_abandonment.ipynb : Notebook file contaning the exploration and analysis of the work.
3. README.md : The readme file for write-up.

## Summary of the results
If a customer is visiting to the website and adding some items to the cart at that time we are predicting that he will do abandonment or not. By knowig so, we can suggest him some offers or give them some vouchers so that he can checkout the product successfully. 

Benefit of this is cart abandonment ratio will decrease which in terms increase in profits(business perspective).

## Prediction is divided into the following steps
1. Reading Dataset
2. EDA
3. Data pre-processing
4. Feature Selection 
5. Modelling
6. Evaluation
7. Load model to pickel file

## How to interact with your project?
Here you just need to install python and install the packages that are listed above and open this .ipymb file in your jupyter notebook and just run all cell or just click <b>SHIFT + ENTER</b> to run cell one by one.

## Licensing
This is just for learning.
